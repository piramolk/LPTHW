#in line 1, you are importing.This is how u add modules/features to script from python feature set
#in this case u must explicitly tell python what u plan to use

#argv is the argument variable. this var holds the arg u pass to ur python script when u run it
#in line 3, we are unpacking argv so instead of holding all arg we are assigning it to four variables


#when exe u must type python ex13.py first 2nd 3rd
#u MUST pass 3 command line arguments

#if u fewer arg and pass more arg than needed it'll just ignore 
#if ur script has more arg than u give it, error will occur

#can replace script/first/second with raw_input()


#Whats the difference between argv and rawinput()?
#The difference has to do with where the user is required to give input. If they give your script
#inputs on the command line, then you use argv. If you want them to input using the keyboard
#while the script is running, then use raw_input().



#Are the command line arguments strings?
#Yes, they come in as strings, even if you typed numbers on the command line. Use int() to convert
#them just like with raw_input().
