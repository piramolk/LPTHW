#importing arguments from the system, basically creating variables
from sys import argv

#assigning variables to argv
script, filename = argv

#the text generated comes from opening the file
txt = open(filename)

#prints out the filename from the input
print "Here's your file %r:" % filename

#prints out the text from the file
print txt.read()

#asks for input
print "Type the filename again:"

#asks for hte file name again so it can reopen that file
file_again = raw_input("> ")

#creates a var called text again . the text comes from the file that is opened
txt_again = open(file_again)

#the text from the reopened file is now printed
print txt_again.read()

#what is hard coding
#putting info that shuld come from the user as a string right in our program
#why not? we want it to load other files later
#soln: use argv and raw_input


#what does txt= open(filename) do?
#It actually makes something called a “file object.” You can think of it like an old
#tape drive that you saw on mainframe computers in the 1950s or even like a DVD player from
#today. You can move around inside them, and then “read” them, but the fi le is not the contents.
