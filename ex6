#What’s the point of %s and %d when you can just use %r?
#The %r is best for debugging, and the other formats are for actually displaying variables to users.

#Why do you put ' (single- quotes) around some strings and not others?
#Mostly it’s because of style, but I’ll use a single- quote inside a string that has double- quotes. Look at line 10


#Study Drills
#1. Go through this program and write a comment above each line explaining it.
#2. Find all the places where a string is put inside a string. There are four places.
#3. Are you sure there are only four places? How do you know? Maybe I like lying.
#4. Explain why adding the two strings w and e with + makes a longer
