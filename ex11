#what does raw_input()do?
#Python also has a feature which lets you interact with the outside world to get input.  The raw_input() function waits for the user to type some input and press return.  It then gets whatever was typed.

# if u type 5"6, the string becomes '', if 5'6, ""
# Whatâ€™s the difference between input() and raw_input()?
# The input() function will try to convert things you enter as if they were Python code, but it has
# security problems so you should avoid it.
