#Why does %r sometimes print things with single- quotes when I wrote them with double- quotes?
#Python is going to print the strings in the most effi cient way it can, not replicate exactly the way
#you wrote them. This is perfectly fi ne since %r is used for debugging and inspection, so itâ€™s not
#necessary that it be pretty.


#Study Drills
#1. Do your checks of your work, write down your mistakes, and try not to make them on
#the next exercise.
#2. Notice that the last line of output uses both single- quotes and double- quotes for individual
#pieces. Why do you think that is?
